# remastered-snake-game
i wanted a more user friendly experience, so this is meant to be the classic snake game but with a modern ui so touch screen control or mous clicks depending on the users device. i wanted to remove the up down left right key bindings so i could free up the snakes movement , the new snake movement should be in any direction on the screen
